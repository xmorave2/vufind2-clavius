INSTALL
=======

WARNING: VuFind 2.0 is a work in progress.

Currently to try out the VuFind 2.0 interface we recommend installing it side-by-side
on a system that is already running a 1.x version of VuFind. All external
dependencies like the Zend Framework are bundled in to the Vufind 2.0 code base.
We will use the same Solr index and MySQL database for both interfaces. You should
use the 1.x vufind.sh script to start/stop Solr and the 1.x import-marc.sh script to
import data into the Solr index.

Instructions
============

1. Install VuFind 1.x (see http://vufind.org/wiki/installation)

2. Pull Vufind2 code from the SVN repository

svn export https://vufind.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vufind/branches/vufind2/ /usr/local/vufind2

3. Run the VuFind2 install script:

cd /usr/local/vufind2
php install.php

Be sure you choose a base path for the URL that does not conflict with VuFind 1.x (/vufind2
is a good choice).

4. Copy your VuFind 1.x config.ini into VuFind 2.0:

cp -p /usr/local/vufind/web/conf/config.ini /usr/local/vufind2/local/application/configs/config.ini

If you are not already using the "blueprint" theme, be sure to edit VuFind 2.0's copy
of config.ini to change the "theme" setting in the "[Site]" section to "blueprint"
since other themes are not yet supported.

Additionally, not all ILS drivers have been ported over yet; if in doubt, you can use
the "Demo" driver. Similarly, some Authentication options are not available yet; LDAP
is your best bet for the moment.

5. Create a symlink to VuFind2's Apache configuration file and restart Apache.

ln -s /usr/local/vufind2/local/httpd-vufind.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/vufind2
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

6. Ensure that your web server can write to the cache directories
(Apache)
chown www-data:www-data /usr/local/vufind2/cache /usr/local/vufind2/local/cache

(Note that these steps may vary depending on your operating system).
